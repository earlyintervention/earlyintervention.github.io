            <p>
                Although the diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) usually happens over 2 years of age, parent-led early intervention strategies can start earlier. 
                This guide helps parents to adopt practical strategies as they navigate through the earliest years of ASD parenting.
            </p>
        
            <p>This guide is suitable for you if:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>You are a parent with ASD or ADHD family history</li>
                <li>You have noticed stereotyical ASD traits in your baby from 6+ months old</li>  
            </ul> 
            
            <p>
                <strong>Remember:</strong> Early intervention is not about suppressing or 'fixing' neurodivergent traits. 
                It is about developing tailored strategies to build more interpersonal connection, social communication and emotional regulation with your child. 
                Always consult your GP or a paediatrician if you have concerns and get in touch with early intervention specialists.

            <strong>Remember:</strong> There is no best earliest timeline for early intervention. 
            Each child develops at their own pace and ASD developmental milestones are often non-linear.
